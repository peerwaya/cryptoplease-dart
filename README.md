## Packages

- [espressocash_app]: full-fledged mobile wallet for iOS and Android on Solana built with [solana] library.
- The [solana] library. This is the implementation of the Solana [transaction codec][transaction_codec] and the [JSON RPC api][json_rpc_api].
- The [jsonrpc_client] is used to generate the RPC api methods from their definitions. This technique helps us stick to the DRY principle very easily.
- The Borsh serialization package which is itself divided in two packages [borsh] and [borsh_annotation]. The former is a code generator that generates borsh serialization and deserialization for a Dart class. And the latter is an annotation used to annotate these classes.
- The [solana_mobile_wallet] and [solana_mobile_client] packages. The former is a reference implementation of the [Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter][mobile_wallet_spec], containing a [Fake Wallet][solana_mobile_wallet_example] to exemplify the scenario callbacks. The latter is the client-side implementation for the [solana_mobile_wallet] scenarios, also containing a [Fake DApp example][solana_mobile_client_example].
- The [solana_seed_vault] package, which implements the [Solana Seed Vault SDK][seed_vault_spec] for Flutter.
